/* Create table PROD_CHEM_MAJOR_AI, which is a subset of table PROD_CHEM containing
	only records where the percent of AI in a product is greater than 75% of the maximum
	percent AI in that product.  The reason for this is that outliers are determined by
	looking at rates of use of AIs, but minor AIs in a product will have a low rate and
	are probably not useful and even misleading for finding high rates.  This table is
	only used for the outlier scripts. It may need to be recreated occasionally to
	update it for new products.
